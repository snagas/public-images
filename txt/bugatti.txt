During the war Ettore Bugatti was sent away, initially to Milan and later to Paris, 
but as soon as hostilities had been concluded he returned to his factory at Molsheim.[1] 
Less than four months after the Versailles Treaty formalised the transfer of Alsace from 
Germany to France, Bugatti was able to obtain, at the last minute, a stand at the 15th 
Paris motor show in October 1919.[1] He exhibited three light cars, all of them closely 
based on their pre-war equivalents, and each fitted with the same overhead camshaft 
4-cylinder 1,368cc engine with four valves per cylinder.[1] Smallest of the three was a 
"Type 13" with a racing body (constructed by Bugatti themselves) and using a chassis with 
a 2,000 mm (78.7 in) wheelbase.[1] The others were a "Type 22" and a "Type 23" with 
wheelbases of 2,250 and 2,400 mm (88.6 and 94.5 in) respectively.[1]
